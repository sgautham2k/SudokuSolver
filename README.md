# Sudoku Solver
A sudoku solver built using Python 3. I am going to warn you all, that this involves backtracking which is a pretty complex topic to get a grasp on if you are an absolute beginner/ rookie so I would advice looking at getting the grips of loops, functions and the basic instructions of python before you come to trying to understand this code. I'm currently working on building a GUI for it !
